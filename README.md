Hi, I’m @Sas0rry! I’m interested in cybersecurity, particularly in learning how to avoid scams and protect myself from tracking. I’m also curious about methods for tracing individuals based on phone numbers, emails, or images, though I currently lack guidance and would appreciate any mentorship or resources. Right now, I’m exploring programming and cybersecurity as a beginner and hope to deepen my skills. Although I haven’t released any official software, I enjoy experimenting with code and making small edits to learn more. You can reach me at syahir7786@gmail.com, and my pronouns are he/him. Fun fact: I’m always excited to pick up new skills and work on projects, even if they’re beginner-friendly!
